       "0  Went through the drive through and ordered a #10 (cripsy sweet chili chicken wrap) without fries- the lady couldn't understand that I did not want fries and charged me for them anyways. I got the wrong order- a chicken sandwich and a large fries- my boyfriend took it back inside to get the correct order. The gentleman that ordered the chicken sandwich was standing there as well and she took the bag from my bf- glanced at the insides and handed it to the man without even offering to replace. I mean with all the scares about viruses going around... ugh DISGUSTING SERVICE. Then when she gave him the correct order my wrap not only had the sweet chili sauce on it, but the nasty (just not my first choice) ranch dressing on it!!!! I mean seriously... how lazy can you get!!!! I worked at McDonalds in Texas when I was 17 for about 8 months and I guess I was spoiled with good management. This was absolutely ridiculous. I was beyond disappointed.   \n",

There are a few helpers taking your orders throughout the drive-thru route and they are the worst. They rush you in placing an order and gets impatient once the order gets a tad bit complicated.  Don't even bother changing your mind oh NO! They will glare at you and snap at you if you want to change something.  I understand its FAST food, but I want my order placed right.

       "7  My friend and I stopped in to get a late night snack and we were refused service. The store claimed to be 24 hours and the manager was standing right there doing paper work but would not help us. The cashier was only concerned with doing things for the drive thru and said that the manager said he wasn't allowed to help us. We thought it was a joke at first but when realized it wasn't we said goodbye and they just let us leave. I work in a restaurant and this is by far the worst service I have ever seen. I know it was late and maybe they didn't want to be there but it was completely ridiculous.
